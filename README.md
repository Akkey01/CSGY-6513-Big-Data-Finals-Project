# Project: Urban Transit Reliability and Demand Forecasting
by Jay Daftari(jd5829@nyu.edu), Akshat Mishra (am15111@nyu.edu) and Nikita Gupta(ng3230@nyu.edu).

## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for analyzing NYC MTA subway ridership, service alerts, accessibility, and forecasting future demand using big data techniques.

**Key Components:**
- **ridership-analysis.ipynb:** Explores all processed data sources to derive insights into ridership trends, service alert impacts, and accessibility patterns. Includes time-series visualizations (rush-hour peaks, midday troughs), alert frequency histograms, and GeoPandas maps of ADA compliance.
- **big-data-project.ipynb:** Trains and evaluates an XGBoost regression model for daily ridership forecasting. Implements hyperparameter tuning (randomized search), model evaluation metrics (RÂ², RMSE), and SHAP-based global and local feature importance analyses.

-  **Dashboard:**

## 2. High-Level Code Logic

## 2.1 Loading

- Leveraged PySpark for handling large datasets and efficient sampling.  
- Example: Sampled 1% of the "Hourly Ridership Data" for exploratory analysis to manage memory usage and improve computation speed.

## 2.2 Cleaning

- Removedduplicates to ensure data integrity.  
- Handledmissing values to avoid inconsistencies in analysis.  
- Standardized column names for uniformity across datasets.

## 2.3 Transformation

- Created ageosphere for mapping geographic locations using latitudes and longitudes.  
- Calculated and added a distance parameter derived from geosphere calculations to analyze ridership patterns relative to location.  
- Derived newfeatures, such as:  
  - "DayofWeek"forunderstanding weekly ridership trends.  
  - "HourofDay"for analyzing peak and off-peak usage.

## 2.4 Merging

- Integrated multiple datasets by utilizing key attributes:  
  - Station Complex ID for unifying station-level data.  
  - Transit Times for detailed ridership analysis.  
  - AgencyInformation for merging ridership datasets.

## 2.5 Exploratory Analysis

- Use Jupyter notebook to analyze hourly/daily ridership patterns.  
- Visualize service alert frequency and impact on ridership.  
- Map ADA-compliance gaps with GeoPandas.
  
## 2.6  MTA Ridership Explorer Dashboard
- **Dynamic Filtering & Metrics**: Select any station and date range to instantly update total and average daily ridership, with easy CSV export.  
- **Multi-Scale Time-Series Views**: Visualize ridership over hours, days, and weeks through interactive Plotly charts to uncover peak usage patterns.  
- **Geospatial Context**: See each stationâ€™s location on an embedded Folium map, aiding route planning and spatial analysis.  
- **Forecasting & Trend Analysis**: Generate 7-day ridership forecasts using Prophet (with uncertainty bands) and compare multiple stationsâ€™ daily trends side-by-side by borough.  
- **Revenue & Operational Insights**: Drill into revenue by payment method and fare class via a vibrant sunburst chart, and explore additional insights like ridership vs. distance to central and hour-of-day breakdowns.  

## 2.7 Model Training

- Load processed data into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Split into training and test sets.  
- Train an XGBoost regressor with hyperparameter tuning (randomized search).  
- Evaluate RÂ² and RMSE on test set.

## 2.8 Interpretability

- Compute SHAP values on a stratified sample.  
- Generate feature importance plots and local explanation examples.
